      <p>I really give it to my mother. These little beings are the messiest, hard headedest, grossest people I've ever met. I didn't know I was going to become a human tape recorder or a maid. Oh, and peace and quiet what's that? Did you know that referee becomes one of your job titles when you have more than one? I don't get to eat any of my favorite snacks without sharing, unless I hide it and sneak and eat it. I can't go to the bathroom in peace either. I hope that changes one day soon lol.   </p>

         Is It Really That Bad?

         Whew! Rant over, all jokes aside. I love all 5 of them with every breath in me and they really are my world. It's usually when they're sleeping but I still look at all of and say "aww look at my babies". I love all 5 of their different personalities. The house is usually a mad house but it's also full of joy and laughter. Without them even knowing it, whenever I'm feeling down one of them always comes and does something to make me smile or laugh. I get to hear how I'm the best mama in the world very often and it's usually over the smallest things. And they give me an excuse to act like a big kid.

      <h2>Meet My Babies</h2>

      <img src = "images/228214_1024948271775_6725209_n.jpg"  alt = "Baby Keyah">

      <p>Theres Keyah, my first born. She 14. Her entrance into to world was actually one the scariest experiences of my life. She was born at only 25 weeks, weighing a whopping 1lb 8oz. I was scared that she wouldn't survive or that she would have a lot of medical problems. She did have a bleed on her brain and I was told that she might have cerebral palsey. That wasn't the case though. There were a few obstacles along the way but she overcame them very well. A teenager now, I'm glad that she loves Anime over boys(LOL). She enjoys a lot of my favorite shows from the 90's, early 00's as well. As long as I keep pizza rolls, noodles, macaroni, and Cocoa Pebbles she's a very helpful easy going kid.  </p>

      <p>Number two, Kadyn. I wasn't expecting it but I had another preemie. Kadyn was born at 27 weeks weighing in at only 2lbs .5oz. His journey was actually a little tougher than Keyah's. He had to be intubated at birth and it was a struggle for him learn to breathe on his own. He spent five months in the NICU, intubated for four of the five. I didn't get to hear him cry for four months either. I signed off to have a trach put in his neck but I guess he wasn't having it. He got his self off of the ventilater and he did not need the trach after all. We did have several hospital stays after he was discharged from the NICU. Due to him being intubated for so long the smallest cold was major for him and it usually landed him in the hospital on oxygen. As he grew older developed new lung tissue that problem slowly went away. He'll be 13 next month. He loves Roblox, Call of Duty, and Fortnite. Pretty chill kid when he's not fighting his brother. As long as he's fed and has the Playstation or his phone he's good. </p>

      <p>Number three, Kamren, he's 10 and my third preemie. I thought he would be my first full term pregnancy but he had other plans. My water broke at 27 weeks and I had him five days later. He weighed 2lb 12oz. I was NICU veteran then so his stay was pretty much a breeze. With the exception of him going back in the hospital for pneumonia a month after being discharged from the NICU, he developed really well and had no issues. This is my child that always annoys the heck out of me but makes me laugh at same time.  He's a typical 10 year boy that loves video games and his phone.</p>

      <p>Number four, my Princess Joelle, she's 5. She's one of the bosses of the house. She has everyone except Keyah wrapped around her finger. Keyah say's that crying mess doesn't work on her. She loves LOL dolls, Barbies, and a lot of other girly toys. She enjoys making Tic Toks and watching AMSR and doll make overs on You Tube. When she's not doing that her and Joseph are usually tag teaming their older brothers. </p>

      <p>My baby of the bunch, Joseph, he's 3. Joseph is my Sour Patch kid, he really is sour and sweet. He spends his days terrorizing everyone, especially the older brothers. I call him the candy monster too. If I didn't make him eat food he would eat candy all day. He loves the Marvel characters, Paw Patrol, and Ryan. When he's not beating up his brothers he's playing with his toys or on Youtube.</p>
